#+TITLE:bf2png: Turn Brainfuck code into a PNG

This project is inspired by image-based malware analysis.
What if we turned Brainfuck code into images, just for the fun of it.
That's what bf2png does.

* Getting Started
Clone the repo:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/aartaka/bf2png
#+end_src

and then use the script:
#+begin_src sh
  ./bf2png.lisp /path/to/file.bf file.png
#+end_src

* Example
See [[./os.png]] for the example of the output.
It's based on the [[https://github.com/bf-enterprise-solutions/os.bf][os.bf code (by Brainfuck Enterprise Solutions)]].
